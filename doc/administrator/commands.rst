Management commands
===================

pretalx comes with a range of helpful management commands that you can execute
from the command line. Assuming you are in the same environment you installed
pretalx in, for example a certain user or a virtual environment, you'll execute
commands using Python::

  python -m pretalx <command> [<flags>] [<options>]

Database commands
-----------------

``python -m pretalx migrate``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``migrate`` command updates the database tables to conform to what pretalx
expects. Please execute it once upon installation and then on every update. As
``migrate`` touches the database, you should have a backup of the state before
the command run.
Running ``migrate`` if pretalx has no pending database changes will result in
no modification to the database.

If migrations touch upon large populated tables, they may run for some time.
The release notes will include a warning if an upgrade comes with a potentially
long-running migration.

``python -m pretalx showmigrations``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're debugging what state your database is in, the ``showmigrations``
command will show you the current state of all pretalx migrations. It may be
useful debug output to include in bug reports about database problems.

Debug commands
--------------

``python -m pretalx shell`` or ``python -m pretalx shell_plus``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``shell`` command to open a python shell with all the
configuration and the environment that pretalx runs with, so that you can
import pretalx modules.  If you install the ``django_extensions`` and
``ipython`` packages, you can also choose to execute the ``shell_plus`` command
instead, which will give you a shell with tab completion, and will initially
import the classes and methods you will probably need.

``python -m pretalx print_settings``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If other debugging fails, install the ``django_extensions`` package and run
``print_settings`` to receive full settings output â€“ be careful, this will
contain passwords, so you should sanitise it before pasting it anywhere.

If you don't want to install a library for debugging, you can run these
commands instead::

    python -m pretalx shell
    >>> from django.conf import settings
    >>> from pprint import pprint
    >>> pprint(settings.__dict__)

The warning about included passwords and secrets in the output goes for this
version as well.

Core pretalx commands
---------------------

``python -m pretalx rebuild``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``rebuild`` command regenerates all static files. With the ``--clear``
flag, it deletes all existing compiled static files and compiles everything
from scratch. Please run this command after every upgrade.

``python -m pretalx regenerate_css``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``regenerate_css`` command regenerates only the custom CSS for events with
a specified custom color, or custom uploaded styles. This should always be done
automatically on user changes in the web frontend.
You can either specify an event slug with ``--event``. If no event is
specified, the files for all relevant events will be rebuilt.

``python -m pretalx init``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``init`` command allows you to create a superuser and an organiser, to give
you all the tools to start configuring pretalx in the web interface. Please run
this command once in the beginning. You can abort the command at any time, and
it will not write anything to the database.

``python -m pretalx createsuperuser``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need more users after generating your initial administration user,
use ``createsuperuser``. Please note that superusers have access to all areas
of all events.

``python -m pretalx runperiodic``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please run the ``runperiodic`` command via a cronjob in regular intervals.
You can also trigger it manually if you think that something went wrong with
the regular task execution.

``python -m pretalx export_schedule_html``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This command requires an event slug as an argument, and you can optionally
provide the ``--zip`` flag to produce a zip archive instead of a directory
structure. The command will print the location of the HTML export upon
successful exit and will exit with an error code otherwise.

``python -m pretalx import_schedule``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``import_schedule`` allows you to import a conference schedule xml file.
It takes the path to the xml file as its argument. If pretalx can find no event
with the specified slug in the database, it will create a new event and a new
organiser.

If the event existed already, pretalx will release a new schedule version for
that event based on the data of the schedule import.
