.. spelling:: nginx systemd 

Installation
============

This guide will help you to install pretalx on a Linux distribution, as long as
the prerequesites are present.

We also provide an `Ansible role`_ that follows this guide, in case you
already have an Ansible-based setup. If you prefer a docker setup, please use
our `docker-compose setup`_.

Step 0: Prerequisites
---------------------

Please set up the following systems beforehand, we'll not explain them here (but see these links for
external installation guides):

* **Python 3.6** and ``pip`` for Python 3.6. You can use ``python -V`` and ``pip3 -V`` to check.
* An SMTP server to send out mails
* An HTTP reverse proxy, e.g. `nginx`_ or Apache to allow HTTPS connections
* A `MySQL`_ (5.6 or higher) or `PostgreSQL`_ (9.4 or higher) database server (you can use SQLite, but we strongly recommend not to run SQLite in production)
* A `redis`_ server

We also recommend that you use a firewall, although this is not a pretalx-specific recommendation.
If you're new to Linux and firewalls, we recommend that you start with `ufw`_.

.. note:: Please do not run pretalx without HTTPS encryption. You'll handle user data and thanks
          to `Let's Encrypt`_, SSL certificates are free these days. We also *do not* provide
          support for HTTP-exclusive installations except for evaluation purposes.

Step 1: Unix user
-----------------

As we do not want to run pretalx as root, we first create a new unprivileged user::

    # adduser pretalx --disabled-password --home /var/pretalx

In this guide, all code lines prepended with a ``#`` symbol are commands that
you need to execute on your server as ``root`` user (e.g. using ``sudo``); you
should run all lines prepended with a ``$`` symbol as the unprivileged user.


Step 2: Database setup
----------------------

Having the database server installed, we still need a database and a database
user. We can create these with any kind of database managing tool or directly
on our database's shell, e.g. for MySQL::

    $ mysql -u root -p
    mysql> CREATE DATABASE pretalx DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;
    mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pretalx.* TO pretalx@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '*********';
    mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Or for PostgreSQL::

  postgres $ createuser pretalx -P
  Enter password for new role:
  Enter it again:
  postgres $ createdb pretalx
  postgres $ psql
  postgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE pretalx to pretalx;

Replace the asterisks with a password of your own. For MySQL, we will use a Unix domain socket to
connect to the database. For PostgreSQL, be sure to configure the interface binding and your
firewall so that the docker container can reach PostgreSQL.


Step 3: Package dependencies
----------------------------

To build and run pretalx, you will need the following Debian packages beyond the dependencies
mentioned above (plus ``libmysqlclient-dev`` if you use MariaDB)::

    # apt-get install git build-essential python3-virtualenv libssl-dev gettext


For Ubuntu 16.04/Debian 9 you need the package "python3.6"::

    # add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/python-3.6
    # apt-get update
    # apt-get install python3.6 python3.6-dev python3.6-venv
    # wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
    # python3.6 get-pip.py

Replace all further "pip" commands with "pip3.6"


Step 4: Configuration
---------------------

We now create a config directory and config file for pretalx::

    # mkdir /etc/pretalx
    # touch /etc/pretalx/pretalx.cfg
    # chown -R pretalx:pretalx /etc/pretalx/
    # chmod 0600 /etc/pretalx/pretalx.cfg

Fill the configuration file ``/etc/pretalx/pretalx.cfg`` with the following content (adjusted to your environment):

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/pretalx.example.cfg
   :language: ini

Step 5: Installation
--------------------

Now we will install pretalx itself. Please execute the following steps as the ``pretalx`` user. We will
install all Python packages, including pretalx, in the user's Python environment, so that your global Python
installation will not know of them::

    $ pip install --user -U pip setuptools wheel pretalx redis gunicorn

pretalx works your choice of database backends â€“ we recommend using
PostgresQL, but MySQL, SQLite, and Oracle work as well. use the following
command to install the database driver (unless you use SQLite, which has its
driver built in):

+------------+-------------------------------------------+
| Database   | pip package                               |
+============+===========================================+
| PostgresQL | ``pip install --user -U psycopg2-binary`` |
+------------+-------------------------------------------+
| MySQL      | ``pip install --user -U mysqlclient``     |
+------------+-------------------------------------------+
| Oracle     | ``pip install --user -U cx_Oracle``       |
+------------+-------------------------------------------+

We also need to create a data directory::

    $ mkdir -p /var/pretalx/data/media

We compile static files and translation data and create the database structure::

    $ python -m pretalx migrate
    $ python -m pretalx rebuild

Now, create an admin user, organiser and team by running::

    $ python -m pretalx init

Step 6: Starting pretalx as a service
-------------------------------------

We recommend starting pretalx using systemd to make sure it starts up after a reboot. Create a file
named ``/etc/systemd/system/pretalx-web.service`` with the following content::

    [Unit]
    Description=pretalx web service
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    User=pretalx
    Group=pretalx
    WorkingDirectory=/home/pretalx/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pretalx
    ExecStart=/home/pretalx/.local/bin/gunicorn pretalx.wsgi \
                          --name pretalx --workers 4 \
                          --max-requests 1200  --max-requests-jitter 50 \
                          --log-level=info --bind=127.0.0.1:8345
    Restart=on-failure

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

If you decide to use Celery (giving you asynchronous execution for long-running
tasks), you'll also need a second service
``/etc/systemd/system/pretalx-worker.service`` with the following content::

    [Unit]
    Description=pretalx background worker
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    User=pretalx
    Group=pretalx
    WorkingDirectory=/home/pretalx/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pretalx
    ExecStart=/home/pretalx/.local/bin/celery -A pretalx.celery_app worker -l info
    WorkingDirectory=/var/pretalx
    Restart=on-failure

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

You can now run the following commands to enable and start the services::

    # systemctl daemon-reload
    # systemctl enable pretalx-web pretalx-worker
    # systemctl start pretalx-web pretalx-worker

Step 7: SSL
-----------

The following snippet is an example on how to configure a nginx proxy for pretalx::

    server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 ipv6only=on default_server;
        server_name pretalx.mydomain.com;
    }
    server {
        listen 443 default_server;
        listen [::]:443 ipv6only=on default_server;
        server_name pretalx.mydomain.com;

        ssl on;
        ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.chain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;

        add_header Referrer-Options same-origin;
        add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:8345/;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
            proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        }

        location /media/ {
            alias /var/pretalx/data/media/;
            add_header Content-Disposition 'attachment; filename="$1"';
            expires 7d;
            access_log off;
        }

        location /static/ {
            alias /path/to/static.dist/;
            access_log off;
            expires 365d;
            add_header Cache-Control "public";
        }
    }

.. note:: Remember to replace the ``python3.6`` in the ``/static/`` path in the config
          above with your python version.

We recommend reading about setting `strong encryption settings`_ for your web server.

You've made it! You should now be able to reach pretalx at https://pretalx.yourdomain.com/orga/ and log in as
the administrator you configured above. You can now create an event, and off you go!

Step 8: Check the installation
-------------------------------

You can make sure the web interface is up and look for any issues with::

    # journalctl -u pretalx-web

If you use Celery, you can do the same for the worker processes (for example in
case the emails are not sent)::

    # journalctl -u pretalx-worker

In the start-up output, pretalx also lists its logging directory, which is also
a good place to look for the reason for issues.


Next Steps: Updates
-------------------

.. warning:: While we try hard not to issue breaking updates, **please perform a backup before every upgrade**.

To upgrade pretalx, please first read through our :ref:`changelog` and if
available our release blog post to check for relevant update notes. Also, make
sure you have a current backup.

Next, please execute the following commands in the same environment (probably
your virtualenv) to first update the pretalx source, then update the database
if necessary, then rebuild changed static files, and then restart the pretalx
services. Please note that you will run into an entertaining amount of errors
if you forget to restart the services.

If you want to upgrade pretalx to a specific release, you can substitute
``pretalx`` with ``pretalx==1.2.3`` in the first line::

    $ pip3 install -U pretalx gunicorn
    $ python -m pretalx migrate
    $ python -m pretalx rebuild
    $ python -m pretalx regenerate_css
    # systemctl restart pretalx-web pretalx-worker
